# 🗂️ use-fs

A set of React hooks to interact with the browser's [File System API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).

Watch a directory for changes and return a map of filepaths & contents when a file is added, modified or removed.

Check out the 📖 [**Storybook**](https://timmikeladze.github.io/use-fs) for a live example.

> ⚠️ Note: The File System API is not fully supported in all browsers yet...but it works in Chrome.
