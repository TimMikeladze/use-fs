# 🗂️ use-fs

A set of React hooks to interact with the browser's [File System API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).

Watches a directory for file changes and rerenders when a file is added, modified or removed.

Check out the 💻 [**use-fs.com**](https://use-fs.app) to see it in action.

> ⚠️ Note: The File System API is not fully supported in all browsers yet...but it works in Chrome.
